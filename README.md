On day 16 of the “30 Days 30 Apps” challenge, we will create a Concerts app with Animation that provides users with a visually engaging experience to explore concerts and music shows. The app will present information about upcoming concerts, including locations, dates, and artists, while adding animated elements to enhance interactivity and visual appeal.
